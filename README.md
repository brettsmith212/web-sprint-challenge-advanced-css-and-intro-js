# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully.

## Interview Questions

### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

   Adding accessibility to your website allows for those with disabilities to still have a good user experience and be able to use your website. Many people are color blind, deaf, blind, or have other impairements that need you to add accessible features for them to have a similar experience to those without those impairements. It also helps with SEO because the website crawlers in Google can decipher your html easier.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.

   (1) You can be sure to fill out all alternative text for images, videos, etc. for screenreaders to explain.
   (2) You can use semantic html so that the code is more readable for screen readers to know what section they are in
   (3) Choose a color palette that is friendly to those with color blindness, such as avoiding reds and greens

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

   A variable is a representation of a value. Just like in basic Algebra, a variable represents a value that can change at any time. It allows you to have the flexibility to change a value as new information is received.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

   Functions allow you to recycle code for the same repeated processes. They make it so that you don't have to keep rewritting the same code over and over again, rather you can call a function whenever you need to do something repeatable.

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

   You can access a key inside of an object with either bracket or dot notation. By accessing the key with either of these two notations it will return the value pair.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Go into canvas and connect your reop to codegrade
3. Clone your forked version of the repo
4. DO NOT CREATE A BRANCH. You will be pushing your changes to the main/master today
   NOTE: tests will run in the JavaScript portion of this challenge only.
5. cd into your repo
6. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
7. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
8. Complete your work making regular commits to main/ master your codegrade score will update each time you make a push.

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start`
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a: Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

_Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css)._

- [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
